<h1>PyOS</h1>
<h2>A linux-like desktop evironment written entirely in python (with tkinter).</h2>
This has taken a very long time to implement but here is the first look at PyOS, a linux-like desktop evironment written entirely (besides a few mandatory .so files) in python.
<h2>How it functions</h2>
This is a linux-like desktop evironment based on Linux-Mint Operating system. It is designed to be ran with only an underlying kernel, window manager and filesystem.
Everything else needed has been either implemented in python, or in low level c++ for things like the drivers it needs (the mandatory .so files);

<h3>How to use it</h3>
<ul>
    <li>First, download the source files and compile them using a python builder like PyInstaller.</li>
    <li>Second, After running the 'installer', set up its root environment.</li>
    <li>Third, create a user.</li>
    <li>Fourth, Enjoy the desktop evironment.</li>
</ul>
