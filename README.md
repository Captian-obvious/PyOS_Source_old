<h1>PyOS</h1>
<h2>A linux-like desktop evironment written entirely in python (with tkinter).</h2>
This has taken a very long time to implement but here is the first look at PyOS, a linux-like desktop evironment written entirely (besides a few mandatory .so files) in python.
<h2>How it functions</h2>
This is a linux-like desktop evironment based on Linux-Mint Operating system. It is designed to be ran with only an underlying kernel, window manager and filesystem.
Everything else needed has been either implemented in python, or in c++ for things like the network system.

<h3>How to use it</h3>
<ul>
    <li>First, download the source files and compile them using a python builder like PyInstaller.</li>
    <li>Second, After running the 'installer', set up its root environment.</li>
    <li>Third, create a user.</li>
    <li>Fourth, Enjoy the desktop evironment.</li>
</ul>
